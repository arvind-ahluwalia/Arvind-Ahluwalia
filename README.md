## Hi, I’m Arvind

I design and operationalize enterprise AI systems that balance autonomy, risk, explainability, and measurable outcomes.

### What I work on
- AI-powered decision systems in real enterprise workflows
- Governance-by-design: explainability, auditability, human-in-the-loop
- Discovery → operating model → production adoption

### Selected outcomes
- 28% attach-rate lift via governed conversational AI (Salesforce)
- ~3% churn reduction through AI-driven renewal intelligence (Palo Alto Networks)
- 30% on-time arrival improvement via ML-based field service optimization

### Current focus
- Agentic AI with decision boundaries
- Trust-first AI operating models
- Enterprise adoption & value realization

### How I think about enterprise AI systems
Enterprise AI succeeds when intent, autonomy, and control are designed together — not treated as separate concerns.
I design AI systems starting from business intent, not models.
- **Why the AI system exists** is established through discovery, decision mapping, and value realization.
- **When AI should act** is defined through explicit decision boundaries based on confidence, risk, and reversibility.
- **How AI is controlled** is embedded directly into system behavior through governance, explainability, and human-in-the-loop mechanisms.

Each layer reinforces the others to enable safe autonomy at enterprise scale.
